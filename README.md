# PushShift User Searcher

Ever wanted to check if a reddit user is trustworthy? Or maybe they removed a post you really really liked, or had info you desperately need?

Now you can easily scan through their submission history ðŸ˜Ž

Check it out here: https://pushift-user-searcher.vercel.app/

You can filter your search by:

-   Specifying one or more subreddits
-   Keywords
-   NSFW or SFW

You can also sort the results by:

-   Creation date
-   Upvotes
-   Comment number

All this ascending or descending.
